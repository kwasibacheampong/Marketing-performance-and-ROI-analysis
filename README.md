## Overview
This project evaluates marketing performance across multiple channels to support ROI-driven budget and campaign decisions. The project demonstrates marketing analytics and ROI analysis skills to support campaign performance evaluation and budget optimisation.

The focus is on identifying which activities contribute most effectively to business outcomes rather than surface-level engagement metrics.

## Business context
Marketing teams often face pressure to justify spend while managing multiple channels and campaigns.

This project reflects a scenario where leadership wants to:
- Understand ROI by channel
- Identify inefficient spend
- Improve future budget allocation

## Key business question
Which marketing channels and campaigns deliver meaningful business value, and how should budget be reallocated to improve overall performance?

## Data & assumptions
The analysis uses campaign-level data including:
- Spend
- Conversions or leads
- Revenue or revenue proxies

Attribution assumptions are clearly stated to keep the analysis transparent and realistic.

## Analytical approach
- Aggregate performance by channel and campaign
- Compare spend against revenue contribution
- Evaluate efficiency using ROI and cost-based metrics

The emphasis is on **decision relevance**, not metric overload.

## Key insights
- Higher spend does not necessarily lead to better performance
- Some lower-cost channels deliver stronger ROI
- Performance varies significantly across campaigns within the same channel

## Recommended actions
- Reallocate budget towards consistently high-ROI channels
- Review or pause underperforming campaigns
- Shift reporting focus from vanity metrics to commercial outcomes
- 
## Skills demonstrated
- Business analysis and decision framing
- Data analysis using Python and SQL
- Commercial performance evaluation
- Stakeholder-focused insight communication

## Tools used
- SQL and Python for analysis
- Data visualisation for insight communication
- Business-focused KPI selection

## Limitations & next steps
Future enhancements could include:
- Time-based trend analysis
- Multi-touch attribution modelling
- Integration with customer lifetime value
