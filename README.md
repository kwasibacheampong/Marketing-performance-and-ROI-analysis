# Business Architecture & Decision Intelligence

## Overview
This project explores how business architecture and decision intelligence frameworks can be used to improve how organisations structure, evaluate, and act on decisions.

Rather than focusing on isolated analysis, the work looks at how data, processes, stakeholders, and objectives connect across the business to support more consistent and transparent decision-making.

## Business context
Organisations often struggle not because they lack data, but because decisions are made in silos without a shared understanding of objectives, dependencies, or trade-offs.

This project reflects a scenario where leadership teams want to:
- Improve decision quality
- Align operational decisions with strategic goals
- Reduce friction between commercial, marketing, and client-facing teams

## Key business questions
- How can decisions be structured so they are repeatable, explainable, and aligned to business objectives?
- Where do data and insights add the most value within decision flows?
- How can decision-making be supported across marketing, client service, and account management functions?

## Analytical approach
The project applies business architecture and decision intelligence concepts to:
- Map decision contexts and stakeholders
- Identify decision inputs, constraints, and outcomes
- Clarify where data and analytics should inform judgment rather than replace it

The emphasis is on **decision design**, not automation.

## Key insights
- Poor decisions are often the result of unclear ownership and misaligned objectives rather than lack of data
- Explicitly defining decision criteria improves consistency across teams
- Data is most valuable when embedded into decision processes, not presented as standalone reports

## Practical outcomes
- Clearer linkage between strategy and day-to-day decisions
- Improved alignment between marketing, client service, and account teams
- A repeatable way to assess where analytics can genuinely improve decision-making

## Tools & concepts
- Business architecture principles
- Decision intelligence frameworks
- Analytical reasoning and stakeholder alignment

## Limitations & next steps
This project is conceptual by design. Future work could extend this into:
- Quantitative decision models
- Scenario analysis
- Tool-supported decision dashboards
